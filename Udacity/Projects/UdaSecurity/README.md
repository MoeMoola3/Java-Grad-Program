# UdaSecurity

The UdaSecurity program is a basic GUI application that allows users to perform various tasks related to 
managing their home security system. In order to scale the software the initial program was refactored into a multi-module Maven project.
Unit tests were written using JUnit 5 and Mockito libraries to verify functionality.
