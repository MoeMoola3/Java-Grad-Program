# Legacy Web Crawler

This project uses concurrent programming techniques to enhance a legacy web crawler so that it can take advantage of 
multi-core architectures. The crawler reads configuration from a JSON file, downloads and parses multiple 
HTML documents in parallel and records popular web terms in an output file.
